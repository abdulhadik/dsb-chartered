                For small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the UAE, staying compliant with international accounting standards is not just important, but also simplified through the adoption of IFRS for SMEs. According to UAE Corporate Tax law, if your business's revenue is less than AED 50 million, you are eligible to follow IFRS for SMEs. This tailored standard is designed to reduce the complexity and burden of financial reporting while maintaining global consistency.

          <h2>Why Choose IFRS for SMEs?</h2>
          <p>
          IFRS for SMEs is approximately 10% the size of full IFRS, with fewer disclosures and simplified reporting requirements. It is crafted to suit the unique needs of smaller businesses, making compliance more manageable. The simplified initial and subsequent measurement rules make financial reporting easier, allowing SMEs to focus on growth without getting overwhelmed by the complexity of full IFRS.
