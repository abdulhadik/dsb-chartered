                  IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) is a set of
                  accounting standards developed by the International Accounting
                  Standards Board (IASB) that provides guidelines for how
                  companies should report their financial results and position.
                  The goal is to ensure transparency, accountability, and
                  efficiency in financial markets around the world.

                  In Dubai, and the wider UAE, IFRS is mandatory for most
                  companies, especially for publicly listed companies. Private
                  companies, including those in free zones, are also required to
                  prepare their financial statements in accordance with IFRS.
                  <br></br>
                  <br></br>
