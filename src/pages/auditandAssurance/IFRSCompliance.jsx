                  IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) is a set of
                  accounting standards developed by the International Accounting
                  Standards Board (IASB) that provides guidelines for how
                  companies should report their financial results and position.
                  The goal is to ensure transparency, accountability, and
                  efficiency in financial markets around the world.

                  <br></br>
                  In Dubai, and the wider UAE, IFRS is mandatory for most
                  companies, especially for publicly listed companies. Private
                  companies, including those in free zones, are also required to
                  prepare their financial statements in accordance with IFRS.
                  <br></br>
                  <br></br>
                  The Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) and the UAE
                  Ministry of Economy oversee the application of IFRS in the
                  country, ensuring that companies adhere to these standards.{" "}
                  <br></br>
                  <br></br>
                  Companies in Dubai's various free zones, such as Dubai
                  International Financial Centre (DIFC), are also required to
                  comply with IFRS. DIFC itself follows a regulatory framework
                  that aligns with international standards, including IFRS.{" "}
