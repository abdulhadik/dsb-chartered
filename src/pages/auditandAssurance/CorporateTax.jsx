                  Corporate Tax is a form of direct tax levied on the net income
                  or profit of corporations and other businesses.
                  <br></br>
                  <br></br>
                  On 31 January 2022, the UAE Ministry of Finance announced the
                  introduction of a federal corporate tax in the UAE that will
                  be effective for financial years starting on or after 1 June
                  2023.
                  <br></br>
                  <br></br>
                  Generally, such taxes are computed on the accounting net
                  profit/income of a business, after making adjustments for
                  certain items which will be specified under the UAE Corporate
                  Tax law.

            The tax will be applicable in all businesses including the free
            zones except the activity for the extraction of natural resources.
